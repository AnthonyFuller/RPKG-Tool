Additional Definitions.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  As used herein, &quot;this License&quot; refers to version 3 of the GNU Lesser&#xD;&#xA;General Public License, and the &quot;GNU GPL&quot; refers to version 3 of the GNU&#xD;&#xA;General Public License.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  &quot;The Library&quot; refers to a covered work governed by this License,&#xD;&#xA;other than an Application or a Combined Work as defined below.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  An &quot;Application&quot; is any work that makes use of an interface provided&#xD;&#xA;by the Library, but which is not otherwise based on the Library.&#xD;&#xA;Defining a subclass of a class defined by the Library is deemed a mode&#xD;&#xA;of using an interface provided by the Library.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  A &quot;Combined Work&quot; is a work produced by combining or linking an&#xD;&#xA;Application with the Library.  The particular version of the Library&#xD;&#xA;with which the Combined Work was made is also called the &quot;Linked&#xD;&#xA;Version&quot;.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  The &quot;Minimal Corresponding Source&quot; for a Combined Work means the&#xD;&#xA;Corresponding Source for the Combined Work, excluding any source code&#xD;&#xA;for portions of the Combined Work that, considered in isolation, are&#xD;&#xA;based on the Application, and not on the Linked Version.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  The &quot;Corresponding Application Code&quot; for a Combined Work means the&#xD;&#xA;object code and/or source code for the Application, including any data&#xD;&#xA;and utility programs needed for reproducing the Combined Work from the&#xD;&#xA;Application, but excluding the System Libraries of the Combined Work.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  1. Exception to Section 3 of the GNU GPL.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  You may convey a covered work under sections 3 and 4 of this License&#xD;&#xA;without being bound by section 3 of the GNU GPL.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  2. Conveying Modified Versions.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  If you modify a copy of the Library, and, in your modifications, a&#xD;&#xA;facility refers to a function or data to be supplied by an Application&#xD;&#xA;that uses the facility (other than as an argument passed when the&#xD;&#xA;facility is invoked), then you may convey a copy of the modified&#xD;&#xA;version:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;   a) under this License, provided that you make a good faith effort to&#xD;&#xA;   ensure that, in the event an Application does not supply the&#xD;&#xA;   function or data, the facility still operates, and performs&#xD;&#xA;   whatever part of its purpose remains meaningful, or&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;   b) under the GNU GPL, with none of the additional permissions of&#xD;&#xA;   this License applicable to that copy.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  3. Object Code Incorporating Material from Library Header Files.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  The object code form of an Application may incorporate material from&#xD;&#xA;a header file that is part of the Library.  You may convey such object&#xD;&#xA;code under terms of your choice, provided that, if the incorporated&#xD;&#xA;material is not limited to numerical parameters, data structure&#xD;&#xA;layouts and accessors, or small macros, inline functions and templates&#xD;&#xA;(ten or fewer lines in length), you do both of the following:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;   a) Give prominent notice with each copy of the object code that the&#xD;&#xA;   Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are&#xD;&#xA;   covered by this License.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;   b) Accompany the object code with a copy of the GNU GPL and this license&#xD;&#xA;   document.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  4. Combined Works.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  You may convey a Combined Work under terms of your choice that,&#xD;&#xA;taken together, effectively do not restrict modification of the&#xD;&#xA;portions of the Library contained in the Combined Work and reverse&#xD;&#xA;engineering for debugging such modifications, if you also do each of&#xD;&#xA;the following:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;   a) Give prominent notice with each copy of the Combined Work that&#xD;&#xA;   the Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are&#xD;&#xA;   covered by this License.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;   b) Accompany the Combined Work with a copy of the GNU GPL and this license&#xD;&#xA;   document.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;   c) For a Combined Work that displays copyright notices during&#xD;&#xA;   execution, include the copyright notice for the Library among&#xD;&#xA;   these notices, as well as a reference directing the user to the&#xD;&#xA;   copies of the GNU GPL and this license document.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;   d) Do one of the following:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;       0) Convey the Minimal Corresponding Source under the terms of this&#xD;&#xA;       License, and the Corresponding Application Code in a form&#xD;&#xA;       suitable for, and under terms that permit, the user to&#xD;&#xA;       recombine or relink the Application with a modified version of&#xD;&#xA;       the Linked Version to produce a modified Combined Work, in the&#xD;&#xA;       manner specified by section 6 of the GNU GPL for conveying&#xD;&#xA;       Corresponding Source.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;       1) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the&#xD;&#xA;       Library.  A suitable mechanism is one that (a) uses at run time&#xD;&#xA;       a copy of the Library already present on the user's computer&#xD;&#xA;       system, and (b) will operate properly with a modified version&#xD;&#xA;       of the Library that is interface-compatible with the Linked&#xD;&#xA;       Version.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;   e) Provide Installation Information, but only if you would otherwise&#xD;&#xA;   be required to provide such information under section 6 of the&#xD;&#xA;   GNU GPL, and only to the extent that such information is&#xD;&#xA;   necessary to install and execute a modified version of the&#xD;&#xA;   Combined Work produced by recombining or relinking the&#xD;&#xA;   Application with a modified version of the Linked Version. (If&#xD;&#xA;   you use option 4d0, the Installation Information must accompany&#xD;&#xA;   the Minimal Corresponding Source and Corresponding Application&#xD;&#xA;   Code. If you use option 4d1, you must provide the Installation&#xD;&#xA;   Information in the manner specified by section 6 of the GNU GPL&#xD;&#xA;   for conveying Corresponding Source.)&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  5. Combined Libraries.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  You may place library facilities that are a work based on the&#xD;&#xA;Library side by side in a single library together with other library&#xD;&#xA;facilities that are not Applications and are not covered by this&#xD;&#xA;License, and convey such a combined library under terms of your&#xD;&#xA;choice, if you do both of the following:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;   a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work based&#xD;&#xA;   on the Library, uncombined with any other library facilities,&#xD;&#xA;   conveyed under the terms of this License.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;   b) Give prominent notice with the combined library that part of it&#xD;&#xA;   is a work based on the Library, and explaining where to find the&#xD;&#xA;   accompanying uncombined form of the same work.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  6.
